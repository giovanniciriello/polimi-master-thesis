Not all messages arrived from ships contain a ship identifier (imo code). Out of a total of \numprint{38930021} of messages, 20.92\% (8145651) do not possess the imo code, making the task of grouping by ship more complex.
Since they do not have an identification number, for grouping purposes, the ship name was used, which (except for a minority of messages that will be discussed in the data cleaning chapter), is always present.
