   abstract = {We have explored tsunami current signals in maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) data during the 2011 Tohoku, Japan, tsunami. The AIS data were investigated in detail taking into account ship motion and response to tsunami current. Ship velocity derived from AIS data was divided into two components in terms of the ship heading: heading-normal and heading-parallel directions. The heading-normal velocity showed good agreement with the simulated tsunami current, as mentioned in our former research. Here, we found the heading-normal velocity was contaminated by non-tsunami noises that were mostly related to the ship yaw motion around the pivot point. The noises due to the yaw motion were reasonably corrected in the heading-normal velocity. The corrected heading-normal velocity clearly showed better agreement with the simulated tsunami current. Although the heading-parallel velocity is basically the navigation speed, and is mostly controlled by ships’ captain, we could find the heading-parallel velocity was also drifted by tsunami currents. The corrected heading-normal velocity was still a ship response to the tsunami current. Based on an equation of a ship response to tsunami currents, we numerically estimated tsunami current from the corrected heading-normal velocity. We could find very slight improvements in estimating the tsunami currents, which indicated that this operation possibly worked as a secondary correction. Tsunami currents of tens of centimeters per second are expected to be suitably detected using AIS based on discussion on detection limit.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

@article{dbscan_ais,
   abstract = {Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system created to allow ships to communicate with each other by exchanging messages containing information such as vessel's ID, position, speed, heading, etc. AIS is useful in many cases, such as early ship collision detection. However, its terrestrial segment's drawback is a relatively low range (about 74 km, roughly 40 nautical miles). Satellite Automatic Identification System (SAT-AIS) was introduced to overcome this limitation, but it suffers from its own problem known as packet collision. The satellite receives messages from multiple terrestrial cells and communication is synchronized within such cells, but not between them, thus messages got lost or damaged when they appear at the satellite at the same time. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to reconstruct those missing messages and deeply investigate whether or not a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) can be considered in the first stage of the reconstruction. The experiment focuses on findig the optimal parameters for the clustering, running it both on original and damaged data to finally ascertain that DSBCAN can distinguish individual trajectories in a dataset that can be further reconstructed.},
